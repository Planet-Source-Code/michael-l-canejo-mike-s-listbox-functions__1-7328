           Mike's Listbox Functions

Thank you for downloading my listbox functions. After Many goof-ups

I finally figured out how to get this working properly.

This is a little different from previous RemoveEmps and RemoveDoubles

You've seen because all these functions use VB's Built-In Listbox

Procedures. So just examine my coding. I didn't comment it because if you're

An intermediate which this was deisnged for, You should know these simple lines of coding.
